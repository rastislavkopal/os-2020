<p><i>
v6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix<br>
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,<br>
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.<br>
<br><br>
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS<br>

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer<br>
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,<br>
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which<br>
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.<br>
